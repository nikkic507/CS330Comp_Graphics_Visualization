*How do I approach designing software?

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

The new design skills my work on all milestones helped my craft my spacial awareness and scale. Moving things around an XYZ axis and placing the appropriately to match my selected scene was both challenging and fun. I learned how to use textures and lighting to create a 3D scene, which is something I have never done before. 

**What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process I followed for my project work was one object or call at a time. The way this course was created made this easier to stick to. I would create one shape and then run the code to check positioning, scale, and accuracy of recreating my selected 2D picture. I would then add texture and object material to the shape. 

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics I learned are to have patience, test often, comment thoroughly, enjoy the process, be creative, and don't give up. I can apply this to all my future work and be able to create interactive and appealing programs. 

*How do I approach developing programs?

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Everything for this project was new to me. I struggled in the beginning of the course but once I found the flow of creating objects and making to correct calls it was fun. My new development strategies are keeping my code organized, test often, use the libraries available, and be creative. 

**How did iteration factor into your development?

The iterations were vital for the development of my project. I needed to ensure that I followed the mesh set up properly to ensure my objects coded successfully. Using the same set up for each shape helped keep the code fluid. 

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The way the milestones broke up the project into smaller bits made the final project and all the code development easier to understand and gave the space to play with the different aspects to create a scene I was proud of. I plan to use this in the future, starting with the base code and adding to that code with different iterations until the project is complete. 

*How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I have learned how to use OpenGL and the vast libraries that are available to create unique graphics and animations. We used C++ language for this project, a computational language I haven't used much so far, I plan to use this in my future classes. 

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I have always been interested in the creation and functionality of GUIs and computational graphics and visualizations added a new level to what I could create in the future. I'm hoping in my future professional pathway I get the chance to mesh both to create unique and functional systems.
